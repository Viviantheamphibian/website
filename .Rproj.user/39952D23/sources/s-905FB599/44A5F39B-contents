# Introduction
# For my project, I decided to analyze datasets of New York School's SAT and AP scores. The first dataset contains SAT median scores for the different sections as well as how many students took it from each school.
# For the second dataset, passing AP scores were counted for each school, as well as the number of test takers and total exams taken.
# These datasets interested me because I wanted to see if there were correlations with SAT scores and AP scores. Additionally, many other correlations were found between the number of tests taken and high scores. 

SATScores <- read.csv("SAT__College_Board__2010_School_Level_Results.csv", header = TRUE)
APScores <- read.csv("2010__AP__College_Board__School_Level_Results.csv", header = TRUE)

# Tidying the datasets allows for more organized data.  
dty_AP <- gather(APScores, key = "Metric", value = "Number", unlist(names(APScores))[3:5])
dty_SAT <- gather(SATScores, key = "Metric", value = "Number", unlist(names(SATScores))[3:6])

names(dty_AP)[2] <- "School"
names(dty_SAT)[2] <- "School"

# Delete School off of one of the datasets, so that when the two datasets are joined, it will not have two columns for school. The schools are joined by ID number, "DBN". 
# dty_AP$School <- NULL 

# The two data sets were joined by using the code full_join.The two datasets were joined by the common factor, "DBN" which represents a specific code for each School in the New york City district.

# Summary statistics using all 6 core dplyr functions 

# Use filter to filter out students who got a 3,4, or 5 on the AP exam and received a score of 500-600 for SAT Scores.
# From the results of using the code, 50 schools consistently received a mean score above 500 for each section on the SAT as well as showing how many AP exams were passed at the schools.
